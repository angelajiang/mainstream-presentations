Chris:

- Put example task names in parallel DNN figure
- Slide says we maximize Event-F1 score, but you verbally said recall?
- Why include "1a", "1b", etc.?
- Hz?
- Say where the M-Scheduler code is actually running
- Admission control: When do we refuse new apps?
- How long does the scheduler and deployment process take to run?
- Remind us what precision and recall are
- Maybe modify intro to make it clear that the contributions are the
  scheduler and model, not the idea of sharing a trunk.

Daniel:

- blue colour is hard to see
- slide no
Why does this degrade quality?
More sharing =
alignment of text
crosses not visible
-----
I like how it almost looks like arrows
the kink at 95
the accuracy -
sample more or specialise more?
-----
I really like the video
-----
Event F1-score
can we do a 2-by-2 grid?
----
Challenges of searching the state space
joint optimization
-------
annotation of slides with where it is run
--
their data centre
our data centre
------
that dropofff
does it scale the same way?
start off at no sharing and degrade to max sharing
we do both
- tell you capacity - how big a node to provision, what sharing you will need
- and the ability to dynamically respond
---
//at what point
//does the scheduler say we can't send more packages to the edge node
//not doing mission control just yet
//debug applications?
-------
we should have taken out the error bars on "Mainstream balances recall and precision"
